# OneShop
Term Project for PROG31975 Advanced Mobile App Development with professor Jigisha Patel

OneShop is an application that acts like an ecommers application. Users are allowed to sing up, log in, select products, add to cart, and view store loactions to purchase them.

Roles:
Mobin - Sign Up/ Log In using Firebase Database as well as push notifcations. Cleaning up the UI and app flow. If time permits, implement google authentication.

Anais - Allowing user to select products and placing them into shopping cart. Due to the over abundance of items and too many apis, they will be sepereated into categories and each csategories will. 
        contain items  which aren't desribed in specifcity (Ex: Instead of iphone, andriod or samsung, the product will be labeled as phone). 
        Displaying shopping cart view, due to issues with using the swift package manager which somehow gave me unkwon erros, Unfortunatly,I have to implement it the shopping cart without using the database.
        Location Services
       
        
       
Jatin - Saving user cart items in database. Help screen, launch screen, styling UI. 

 
Tyoe of nagivation : Hirarchal navigation but the app won't annoy user when during navigation

Progress so far: Log In and Sign Up Functionality is completed. View for selecting items, view for shopping cart and deleting items. 
Loaction Services (but cannot get the map view to display due to merging issues)

What's next : Help page, push notification and styling UI.
