# OneShop
Term Project for PROG31975 Advanced Mobile App Development with professor Jigisha Patel

OneShop is an application that acts like an ecommers application. Users are allowed to sing up, log in, select products, add to cart, and view store loactions to purchase them.

Roles:
Mobin - Sign Up/ Log In using Firebase Database as well as push notifcations.

Anais - Allowing user to select products and placing them into shopping cart. Due to the over abundance of items and too many apis, they will be sepereated into categories and each csategories will. 
        contain items  which aren't desribed in specifcity (Ex: Instead of iphone, andriod or samsung, the product will be labeled as phone). 
        Displaying shopping cart view, due to issues with using the swift package manager which somehow gave me unkwon erros, Unfortunatly,I have to implement it the shopping cart without using the database.
        Navigation between different screens.
        Information page for the user to read about the application.
       
        
       
Jatin - Location Services (Choosing the more popular stores for ex Walmart and Food Basic) and 
        other features. 
 
If Jatin can not be able to complete his part then Anais will have to do it for him.
 
Tyoe of nagivation : Hirarchal navigation but the app won't annoy user when during navigation

Progress so far: Log In and Sign Up Functionality is completed. View for selecting items, view for shopping cart and deleting items. 

What's next : Information page, location services, push notification.
